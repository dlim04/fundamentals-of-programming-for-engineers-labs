# Exercise 3

In this task, you will use **bitwise operators** (`&`, `|`) along with **`if-else` statements** to make decisions based on the results of the operations. The goal is to practice using **bitwise operations** and **conditional logic** in Java.

1. **Input**:
   - Accept two integer inputs from the user.

2. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - Perform the **bitwise AND** (`&`) operation on the two integers.
   - Perform the **bitwise OR** (`|`) operation on the two integers.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If the result of the **AND operation** is greater than `10`, print `"AND result is greater than 10"`. Otherwise, print `"AND result is less than or equal to 10"`.
   - If the result of the **OR operation** is a multiple of `4`, print `"OR result is a multiple of 4"`. Otherwise, print `"OR result is not a multiple of 4"`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BitwiseOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Input values
        System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        // Bitwise Operations

        //If else block for >10


        //If else block for % 4
    }
}
```

## Exercise 2

A restaurant offers discounts to its members for dinner:
- If a customer is a member
  - There is a 5% discount for dinner costing less than £100
  - There is a 10% discount for dinner costing at least £100
- If a customer is not a member, there is no discount

Write a program to calculate the discounted price given the membership status of the individual

# Exercise 1

## Task 1 - Swap 2 variables

Write a program that swaps the values of two variables using a temporary variable.
Print the values of the variables before and after the swap to show that it worked.

```java
a = 123; b = 789; // before swap

// do swap

a = 789; b = 123 // after swap
```


## Task 2 - Swap 3 variables

Extend your program to swap the values of three variables.
If you variables start off as:
```java
a = 10; b = 20; c = 30;
```
After the swap these should be:
```java
a = 30; b = 10; c = 20;
```

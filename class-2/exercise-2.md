# Exercise 2

## Task 1 - Integer Overflow and Underflow

Write a Java program using `byte` data type to demonstrate examples of both integer overflow and underflow.

Print the value of the variable before and after to show the value wrapping round.

Then verify that changing the data type to a larger size prevents the overflow/underflow condition.

## Task 2 - Floating Point Overflow and Underflow

Write a Java program using `float` data type to demonstrate examples of both floating point overflow and underflow.

Print the value of the variable before and after to show the value clipping to Infinity or 0.0.

Then verify that changing the data type to a larger size, i.e. `double`, prevents the overflow/underflow condition.

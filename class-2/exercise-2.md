# Exercise 2 - Characters

## Part 1 - Investigation
1. Analyse the following code:
```java
public class Characters {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        

        char character = '9' + '!';

        System.out.println(character);
    }
}
```
2. Write down using pen and paper the output you'd expect from the program.
3. Create a new source file by right clicking `src` in the Explorer tab in Visual Studio Code and click `New File...`
4. Name the file `Characters.java`
5. Copy and paste in the code and run it. Was the outcome what you expected?

## Part 2 - Do it by hand
1. Use an [ASCII table](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii) to write out the values of `7` and `B` using both a decimal number and an 8 bit binary numbers.
2. Add the values together in both decimal and binary.
3. Convert the result to a character using the ASCII table.

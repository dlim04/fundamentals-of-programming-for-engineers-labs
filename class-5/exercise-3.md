# Exercise 3 - Recursion!
Implement the following algorithm in a function (`factorial()`) to calculate
the factorial of
a given value (`x`):

```
- If the value of x is 0 return 1
- Return x * factorial(x - 1)
```

Call this function in your main function to test it.

Can you explain how this works?

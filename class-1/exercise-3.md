# Exercise 3 - Algorithms

For both of the following tasks write out a flowchart and some pseudocode that describe an algorithm to solve the given task.

You are not expected to write this in Java code.

## Task 1 - Sorting

Write an algorithm that takes in three numbers and carries out each of the following:
- Prints “increasing” and the three numbers in ascending order if they are in increasing order,
- Prints “decreasing” and the three numbers in descending order if they are in decreasing order
- Prints “neither” otherwise.
- Next, sort the numbers in ascending order if the numbers are in neither order.

## Task 2 - Microwave

A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating
three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks
the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. Now write an algorithm that takes in the time to heat one item
and the number of items, perform the calculation, and print out the recommended heating time.
